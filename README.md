Acoustic Keylogging Demo in Matlab

A simple demo that shows how machine learning can be used to distinguish the sound of keypresses from eachother, after a minimal amount of training.

Works very effectively on a set of 3 or 4 keys that sound drastically different from eachother (eg. space bar, letter key, shift, and escape).

Used a high quality condensor microphone a few inches away for recording.
